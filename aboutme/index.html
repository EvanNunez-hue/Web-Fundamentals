    <p>Hello everyone! As you can see my name is Evam, I am 19 years old and my birhtday is in June!
    </p>
     <p>I'm currently majoring in Elementary Education, I really want to be a first-third grade teacher.
     This is my third semester here and I attending school with my brother. When I was in Highschool
     I took an HTML and CSS class in my junior year, and that's where I began to want to kno more about coding
     especially because there is so much technology right now and coding can be used for so many things
     regardless if i'm taking it for myb major, i'm happy to know more about it to help grow my knowledge. I've been a member all my life, but when I was 17 is when I truly started to make strides in my faith!</p>
