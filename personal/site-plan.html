        and I'd like people to be able to relate and leave their own experiences and comments. </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        [This homepage will serve as the backbone of my personal blog, and it will be the main part. This page will have a multipurpose function: a welcoming space 
        for anyone who wants to get to know my site better, and it will be used to have people learn more about who I am and what my interests are. The main focus 
        of this page will be to share a little about who I am, what I care about, and my experiences. I plan to include an image of myself to help create a more 
        personal aspect to the blog, and so people can better connect what they read to a face. Below that, there will be a written introduction that includes my 
        background, hobbies, interests, etc. I want this page to feel casual and inviting, and to open it up for my other two pages.
        Along with my bio, I’ll also link my social media profiles so visitors on my blog can follow me and stay connected with me. It will include platforms like 
        Instagram, indeed, Facebook, and or other platforms. I want to make it easy for people to explore more of my life. This page may also include a gallery of 
        photos, either professional or personal, that reflect important moments in my life or just fun memories I want to share. Lastly, I plan to post regular life 
        updates, either daily or weekly, to keep the homepage fresh and current. These could be short journal-style posts, quick insights, or even random thoughts 
        about how my week is going. Overall, this page is designed to give people a well-rounded look at who I am and what I’m currently up to.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Resume]</h3>
      <p>
        [The resume page will be more professional in its layout and the way it is worded. It will showcase my skills, experience, and qualifications that I offer. 
        I want this page to be useful for anyone who might be interested in working with me, collaborating, or just learning more about my background. It will 
        include my past work experiences, as well as a section that highlights specific skills I’ve developed through both work and personal projects like this one. 
        These could include technical skills, creative abilities, or generalized strengths that I feel are important to share.
        In addition to a traditional resume, like education and certifications, I may also include a small section about personal qualities or strengths that help 
        define how I work with others. Things like being determined, dependable, or a good communicator. This page will allow potential collaborators, employers, or 
        curious visitors to quickly scan and understand what I offer. It will reflect who I am in a confident and organized way. While my resume page will focus 
        more on professional content, it will still fit in with the rest of the site stylistically so that it feels connected to my other pages, while remaining 
        different.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Achievements]</h3>
      <p>
        [My final page, the achievements page, will highlight meaningful personal milestones and goals I’ve reached in life. Unlike the resume page, which is more 
        formal and work based, this section will be more personal while still including slightly professional achievements. I want this page to be a slight mix of 
        my home about me page and my resume page, and I want it to showcase the things I’m proud of. Not only jobs or school accomplishments, but also real life 
        goals I’ve set for myself and achieved or am still progressing toward. That might include creative projects I’ve finished, personal records I’ve beaten, or 
        challenges I’ve overcome. Some achievements may be small but significant, while others may represent larger life events, or things I've actually won awards 
        for.
        This page will be formatted more visually or narratively, with descriptions or even short stories explaining the importance of each achievement. I want 
        people to understand the journey behind each win. Whether it’s completing a fitness goal, learning a new skill, traveling to a new place, or reaching a 
        long-term dream. I hope this page will inspire others to reflect on their own goals and feel motivated to work toward them. It will also serve as a reminder 
        to myself of how far I’ve come and what I’ve been able to do, even when things felt difficult. I want this page to be formatted with a large gallery and 
        include the story/achievement underneath each picture.
